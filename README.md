# ParticleCountCalculator
Calculator to Convert between different particle size standards

This was a project done in my spare time to practice my pythonic skills. Objective of the calculator is take ISO 4406:1999 particle size cleanliness codes and convert them to other recognized standards, such as: NAS 1683 and SAE SA 4059.

This calculator was developed as a non-GUI program and operates with commond line prompts. 

There are no dependnacies required with this program the only import is the library time.
